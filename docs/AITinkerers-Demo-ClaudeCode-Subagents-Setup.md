# Claude Code Subagent Workflow Guide

This guide shows how to use three coordinated Claude Code subagents to build a Next.js portfolio website with automatic quality checks and deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. ‚úÖ Next.js project bootstrapped (see `AITinkerers-Demo-Setup.md`)
2. ‚úÖ Vercel connected to GitHub repository
3. ‚úÖ All quality tools installed (prettier, eslint, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ Claude Code CLI installed and ready

## Step 1: Start Claude Code

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ai-tinkerers-demo

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

## Step 2: Create the Three Subagents

### Create Main Developer Agent
```bash
/agents
```

Follow the steps to create an agent in the local folder. Name the agent accordingly and paste the content from `docs/developer-subagent.md` (everything after the `---` header section). For the description, use the text from the header section. Repeat for other two agents.

## Step 3: Verify Agents are Created

```bash
/agents list
```

You should see all three agents listed.

## Step 4: Start the Coordinated Workflow

### Option A: Automatic Coordination (Recommended)

```bash
Use the developer, quality-monitor, and git-automation subagents to build a Next.js + Tailwind CSS portfolio website.

REQUIREMENTS (must include ALL):
- Homepage with hero section containing "Hello, I'm Indy" headline
- Navigation bar with exactly 2 links: "Home" and "Contact"
- Contact page with email form
- Use Inter font for headings, Slabo for body text
- Clean, minimal design similar to attached inspiration

developer: Create BOTH pages (home + contact) with navigation between them
quality-monitor: Quick format check only
git-automation: Commit after quality approval

Build exactly what's specified above - no more, no less.
```

### Option B: Manual Coordination (Backup)

If automatic coordination doesn't work perfectly:

```bash
# Step 1: Start with main developer
/agents developer "Create a responsive hero section with modern design and Tailwind CSS"

# Step 2: After completion, trigger quality check
/agents quality-monitor "Run quick format check on the completed hero section"

# Step 3: After quality approval, trigger git automation
/agents git-automation "Commit and push the quality-approved hero section"
```

## Step 5: Monitor the Workflow

Watch for these coordination signals:

### Main Developer Signals:
- üî® "Starting implementation of [feature]"
- ‚úÖ "TASK COMPLETED: [feature] - Ready for quality check"

### Quality Monitor Signals:
- üîç "Quality check started for: [feature]"
- ‚úÖ "QUALITY APPROVED: [feature] - Ready for commit"

### Git Automation Signals:
- üì¶ "COMMITTED: [feature] to GitHub"
- üöÄ "PUSHED to GitHub - Vercel deployment triggered"
- ‚úÖ "DEPLOYED successfully: [live-url]"

## Step 6: Add Additional Features

After the first feature is complete and deployed, continue with:

### For About Section:
```bash
developer, quality-monitor, and git-automation: work together to build a responsive about section with personal information and skills showcase
```

### For Projects Section:
```bash
developer, quality-monitor, and git-automation: work together to build an interactive projects showcase with hover effects and project cards
```

### For Contact Section:
```bash
developer, quality-monitor, and git-automation: work together to build a contact form with validation and responsive design
```

## Step 7: Monitor Live Results

Keep these tabs open during development:

1. **Terminal**: Claude Code with subagents
2. **Browser - Local**: `http://localhost:3000` (run `npm run dev` in separate terminal)
3. **Browser - Live**: Your Vercel deployment URL
4. **GitHub**: Repository to see automated commits
5. **Vercel Dashboard**: Deployment status and logs

## Troubleshooting

### If Coordination Breaks:
```bash
# Check for marker files
ls -la .task-completed .quality-approved

# Clear stuck marker files if needed
rm .task-completed .quality-approved

# Restart with manual coordination using /agents commands
```

### If Quality Checks Fail:
The quality-monitor agent will auto-fix most issues. If manual intervention is needed:
```bash
npm run quality
```

### If Git Operations Fail:
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Manual commit if needed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: manual commit after agent issue"
git push
```

### If Vercel Deployment Fails:
Check the Vercel dashboard for build logs and error details.

## Expected Workflow Timeline

For a complete portfolio with 4 sections (hero, about, projects, contact):

- **Hero Section**: 3-5 minutes (initial setup + development)
- **About Section**: 2-3 minutes (agents now in sync)
- **Projects Section**: 2-3 minutes (with interactive elements)
- **Contact Section**: 2-3 minutes (with form validation)

**Total Demo Time**: ~10-15 minutes for a complete, deployed portfolio

## Demo Talking Points

- **"Watch as the development agent builds the feature..."**
- **"Now the quality agent automatically checks and fixes the code..."**
- **"Finally, the git agent commits only after quality approval..."**
- **"And there's the live deployment on Vercel!"**

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Clear coordination messages between agents
‚úÖ Automatic code formatting and linting
‚úÖ Descriptive git commits with quality approval
‚úÖ Successful Vercel deployments
‚úÖ Live website updates with each feature
‚úÖ Professional development workflow maintained

This workflow demonstrates how AI agents can collaborate like a professional development team, maintaining code quality and deployment standards automatically.
