## AI Tinkerers Sydney Demo

This is a demo of using Claude Code with subagents for [AI Tinkerers Meetup, 20 August 2025](https://sydney.aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-sydney-inaugural-meetup-20-august-2025). (Slides are [here](docs/Using_AI_as_your_second_brain-methods_and_practices.pdf))

The project has been prepared for the demo via the steps documented in the [instructions here](docs/AITinkerers-Demo-Setup.md). It is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) with a `vercel.json` file added to avoid deployment issues with Vercel when using Next.js 13+ App Router.

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies with the command -

```bash
npm install
```

You can run the the development server with the command -

```bash
npm run dev
```

and use http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


It is optional to use Vercel for deployments.
